The course started quite well and *smoothly*. I like the introduction by professor Kimmo and generally everything looks quite scheduled and organised. From the course I expect to improve my bioinformatic and data science related knowledge. I already have quite a bit of $R$ skills but I'm sure I will improve those as well with this course: I really like programming and $R$ is a quite cool language. For sure, it shines when used with Rstudio. I actually didn't know about the Git communication! \
I heard about this course from a colleague of mine. \
